# House Prices Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and demographics. The dataset used is a housing dataset containing information about various homes and their prices, with features like the number of rooms, population, and proximity to the ocean.

The workflow includes:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data structure, handling missing values, and deriving insights.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Model Training**: Building and training a Random Forest Regressor to predict house prices.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.
5. **Visualization**: Comparing true and predicted values through scatter plots.

## Requirements
This project requires the following libraries:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computing and handling arrays.
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found in this repository:
- Dataset URL: [Housing Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/datasets/housing/housing.csv)

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **longitude**: Longitude of the house location.
- **latitude**: Latitude of the house location.
- **housing_median_age**: Median age of the houses in the area.
- **total_rooms**: Total number of rooms in the house.
- **total_bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms in the house.
- **population**: Total population of the area.
- **households**: Total number of households in the area.
- **median_income**: Median income of the households.
- **median_house_value**: The target variable, which is the price of the house (the value to predict).
- **ocean_proximity**: The proximity to the ocean (categorical feature).

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
You can clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SiddharthF18/House-Prices-Prediction.git
cd House-Prices-Prediction
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Model
You can run the Python script to train the Random Forest Regressor model and evaluate its performance:
```bash
python house_price_model.py
```

### 4. View Results
Once the script runs, it will display model performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. It will also show a scatter plot comparing the true and predicted house prices.

## Model Explanation
### **Random Forest Regressor**
A **Random Forest Regressor** is an ensemble machine learning model that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree in the forest makes its own predictions, and the final prediction is the average of all tree predictions. Random Forest helps reduce overfitting by averaging the results and is known for its robustness and flexibility.

### **Metrics**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.
- **R-squared**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable (house prices) explained by the model.

## Future Improvements
This project can be expanded or improved in several ways:
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters like the number of trees, max depth, and more.
2. **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to assess the model’s performance across different subsets of the data.
3. **Model Comparison**: Try other regression models like Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), or Gradient Boosting Regressor to compare their performance.
4. **Outlier Handling**: Detect and handle outliers, especially in the target variable (`median_house_value`), to improve model predictions.
